- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarckSSmith
- 👀 At present, I’m interested in how to migrate Exchange 2010 Public Folders to shared mailboxes for further migration to Exchange 2016 on prem.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what tools are available to document PF Rules, Permissions and content, and export/import them to other objects. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on best practices for implementations and upgrades.
